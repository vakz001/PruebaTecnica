Prueba Técnica: Pasantía Proofpoint – Benjamín Vaca
A.
1) Describe the most relevant learnings from programming-related
subjects.
The most relevant experience in my learning journey was when I started
my career in DevOps through a specialized course. During this course, I
learned how to deploy applications, implement CI/CD pipelines, and work
with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform and AWS
CloudFormation. Additionally, I gained hands-on experience with Docker
and Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration.
I also explored AWS services such as EC2, ECS, S3, CloudWatch, and
VPC, which allowed me to understand cloud infrastructure management,
networking, monitoring, and scaling strategies. Furthermore, I developed
strong Linux skills, learning essential commands for configuring and
managing instances, automating tasks, and optimizing system
performance.
This experience provided me with a solid foundation in automation, cloud
computing, and software deployment best practices.
2) Describe a situation you had to resolve with a teammate from a
study or work group.
During our thesis project, my team and I had to address a visualization
requirement for a 3D environment in the e-commerce platform we had
developed. This challenge proved to be quite difficult and complicated
the project for a while. However, we were able to resolve it by utilizing a
Unity API that allowed us to meet the client's specific request. This
experience taught us the importance of collaboration, creative problem
solving, and leveraging the right tools to overcome technical challenges.
3) Describe your personal learning plans or development expectations
in technical areas.
I want to continue specializing in DevOps and Cloud Computing because
it is a technical field that caught my attention and is currently in high
demand. My goal is to deepen my knowledge in automation, cloud
infrastructure, and deployment strategies while gaining a better
understanding of the DevOps culture and its role within a development
team. I aim to refine my skills in CI/CD, container orchestration, and
infrastructure management to contribute effectively to modern software
development environments.
